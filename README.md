# OnnxUtils
A small collection of useful methods for converting ONNX models.  

This repo was created because of the huge number of requests received from this [issue](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorflow/issues/632).  
<b>Thank you for your interest!</b>

## Disclaimer
I'm sorry for the lack of documentation, but this was part of my [Master thesis](https://morethesis.unimore.it/theses/available/etd-11102022-122822/) and I just uploaded the file requested by community.  
Moreover, the Python requirements file may be incomplete.
