# OnnxUtils
A small collection of useful methods for converting ONNX models.  

This repo was created because of the huge number of requests received from this [issue](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorflow/issues/632).  
I'm sorry for the lack of documentation and Python requirements, but this is part of a private project and I just uploaded the file requested by community.  

<b>Thank you for your interest!</b>
